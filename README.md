# QB.Compatibility

QuickBASIC 4.5 and QBasic Compatibility Library for Visual Basic (.NET Core).

This is a (seriously) work-in-progress project that serves to create a compatibility layer for the purpose of migrating QB code to .NET.  It is not lost upon me that there isn't an overwhelming need for such a thing; however, from a mental excercise point of view this project also serves as a way to revisit a clear connection with Visual Basic history to review what we might have lost (and thus what might be gained) along the way.  Additionally, there is a certain *style* of development that QB provided that might be able to be recaptured by having access to some of this *old stuff*.  Finally, this project will (eventually, most likely) be used as part of another pet project that I'd like to do...

If you have QB projects that you'd like to share, I'm always on the lookout for more samples.

Examples of projects that have been converted using the library:

- REMLINE.BAS
- NIBBLES.BAS
- GORILLA.BAS
